# Hide 'Like' Notifications (Google Chrome Extension)

[Chrome Web Store - Hide 'Like' Notifications](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hide-likes-on-facebook-no/kbfakkkdllpodegeoggpfcmjabodhpca)

Are you bothered by "someone likes your post" notifications on Facebook? Hide 'Like' Notifications is for you! You won't miss more critical notifications such as "someone commented on your status."

## How To Contribute

If you still find any annoying notifications, give me feedback.

I would appreciate if you could give me detail information about the element you want to hide from the browser inspection tool.
