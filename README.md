# Hide 'Like' Notifications (Google Chrome Extension)

## Farewell

Farewell

Facebook has changed its design to allow users to suppress distractive notifications. Just turn the More Activity About You option off in the [Notifications Settings][1].

Now that you do not need this Chrome extension. Just remove it.

I hope you enjoy Facebook without distraction.

Regards,
